# Hi there!üëã 
### My name is Yonatan Hen, a Software Engineer.
I'm a Bachelor's (B.Sc.) in Software Engineering from SCE college in Israel.
During my degree studies, I had been exposed to a lot of methodologies, tools, and programming languages such as Python, Java, and more.
Although, during my degree studies I decided to learn Node.js technologies by myself and found it in general, and JavaScript in particular, as my favorite technology to develop websites/mobile apps.
Nevertheless, as a student and even afterward, I'm always learning by solving Leet Code problems, watching online courses, or developing new applications. üßë‚Äçüíª
